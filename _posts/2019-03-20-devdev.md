## Status

### Body

devdev is a working group with the IITPSA to achieve our objectives by working with their professional body.

First objectives:
1. defining scarce skill of software development, clarifying the "rungs on the ladder" of professional development:
    - simplifies hiring processes,
    - assists immigration, and
    - sets the bar for training programmes
2. implement CPD points to encourage engagement of professionals: 
    - in conferences and community events
    - in training courses
    - especially for mentoring
3. Recognise online courses & MooCs

Coder:LevelUp have joined forces with the IITPSA to help them make their professional offering engaging to coders at all stages of professional development. This partnership has replaced our previous goal of creating a professional body, neatly removing duplication.

### Partner Engagement

Having established devdev, we are proceeding to engage with partner organisations to create a representative working group.
