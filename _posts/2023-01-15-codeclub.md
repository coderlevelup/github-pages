Code clubs are school-based extra-mural clubs for young people, practicing coding from first steps through projects in the project pathway.

Code Club provides the resources and support to help teachers start successful coding clubs.

Coder:LevelUp is the Western Cape regional growth partner for the Code Club (and CoderDojo) in a programme sponsored by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. We are helping to train teachers, find volunteers and provide hardware for electronics projects. 

Our 2023/2024 goal is 150 new coding clubs across the 1700+ Western Cape schools, with at least 60% from quintile 1-3 schools.
