Helping young people develop new skills and explore their creativity is very
rewarding. Also, it’s a lot of fun!

Code Club & CoderDojo are free volunteer-led coding clubs for young people that are always looking for volunteers!

# We need your help!

As we're growing, more volunteers help get a better outcome for young people across the network.

You could become a mentor and help young people learn to code. To help beginners, you don’t even need technical skills! 

You could help with setting up the space and recording attendance for the
Dojo sessions. You could help a Dojo run its social media presence or website!
