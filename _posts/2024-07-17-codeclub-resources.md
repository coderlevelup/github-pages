# Raspberry Pi Foundation

The Raspberry Pi foundation works to make coding more accessible to young people. Code club is one pillar that supports this goal, and these free resources are there to help you along your journey.

## Pathways

Paths are a series of 6 projects that help to build your coding and design skills. Paths will help you gain new skills, then make design choices to personalise your projects, and finally create something unique.

Are you a mentor? Have a look at our [guide to paths](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/321-make-mentor-guide).

 * [Scratch Pathways](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/scratch) Begin your adventure in digital making, by learning to code animations, stories, and games in Scratch.
 * [micro:bit pathways](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/microbit) sensors, buttons and lights! In this introduction to coding for the micro:bit, you will learn how to sense and respond to the world around you while looking after yourself.
 * [more pathways...](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths) in Unity, HTML + CSS, Python, Raspberry Pi


## code club "on a stick"

To run code club in classrooms without internet connections, you can copy the code club on a stick folder onto a flash drive and it has installers for scratch and pdfs for all of the scratch pathways. [bit.ly/codeclub-stick](https://bit.ly/codeclub-stick)

## code club Community of Practice

You can also learn by plugging into dynamic people running clubs near & far.

Try joining an event from [code club Training & Events](https://codeclub.org/en/events) to learn and connect with the global community of practice.

Code Club has been growing in schools and South Africa now (July2024) has:
 * 148+ clubs running in Western Cape led by Anelisa Masebe in collaboration with WCED and SADTU
 * Libraries: we're piloting [CoderDojo in the Library](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/CoderDojo-in-the-library) with Cape Town City Libraries identifying an initial 5-10 libraries, which means any of the 104 (yep!) libraries in the city will be potential pilots, and ultimately we'd like to see them all running.
 * 200+ clubs running in KZN led by Julia Reader in collaboration with Keep a Child Alive and Blue Roof
 * 2 new school clubs and 1 library starting led by Esethu Stofile of ECDoE


If you're curious to see if there is already a club near you to connect with, you can check out:
