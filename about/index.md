### Super Powers
Coding is a super-power. 

Coder LevelUp is helping fellow Africans learn this super-power.

### Big Hairy Audacious Goal
Coder Levelup is on a mission to be part of the change that sees 500 000 coders (digital makers) working in the Western Cape.

### How?
Find and run super scalable programs for the growth and development of coders (and potential coders) throughout their lifetime from before “Hello, world!” to retired guru, from age seven to a hundred and seventy.

Specifically, we work across:
 * kids: CoderDojo and Code Club in partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation
 * pros: devdev is a working group with the IITPSA growing a relevant pro body for developers; code retreats are a space for intentional practice
 * start-ups: lean iterator and lean(startup)coffee support early-stage tech startups taking the next steps to success.

### History

 * 2012 First Code Retreat @ afrolabs
